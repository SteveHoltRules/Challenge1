# Code Refactor Challenge

##Purpose
Through out this project my goal was to maintain simplicity, along with documenting the progress of the revisions along the way in the code itself. The project was to revise the accessibility of the html according to html 5 standards and move the structure away from 'div'. The notes about the changes are found in the comments. In addition to the HTML changes, I also changed the CSS to eliminate places where the CSS was redundant. This enables the next person to be able to look at common features of the style and adjust it based on a common class instead of a strick break down based on classes. I have reviewed the code for both accuracy and simplicity and believe I have made the changes to fulfill the prompt.
